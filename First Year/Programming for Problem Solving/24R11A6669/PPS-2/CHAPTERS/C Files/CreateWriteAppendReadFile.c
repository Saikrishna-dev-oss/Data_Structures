//READ (r, r+): Opens a file for reading. If the file doesn’t exist, the operation fails. You can use functions like fread() or fgets() to read data.
//WRITE (w, w+): Opens a file for writing. If the file exists, it overwrites its contents. If it doesn’t exist, a new file is created. Functions like fwrite() or fprintf() help write data.
//APPEND (a, a+): Opens a file for appending. If the file exists, new data is added at the end. If it doesn’t exist, a new file is created. You can use fwrite() or fprintf() for appending.
